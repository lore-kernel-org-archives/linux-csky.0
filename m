There are various reasons for not supporting static calls, and in
general we end up having to have a fall-back path that's *more*
expensive than just loading the pointer.

To be clear, that's ONE specific concern, not the ONLY reason.

As per my other mail, does this meaningfully affect a real workload?

Who is this actually going to matter to?
