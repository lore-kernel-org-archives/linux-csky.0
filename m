I think you've misunderstood my point.

I'm saying that *even if* arm64 supported static calls, we'd have to
have dynamic fallback paths that are more expensive. For example, where
branch range limitations force indirection via an out-of-line stub,
adding an extra BL+RET pair. Note that was the case in the patches you
linked from Ard.

I asked about meaningful impact. For a real workload, does this show up
at all, or does this fall within the noise?

At present, I don't think your singular microbenchmark result changes
our previous decisions regarding static calls. For various reasons, on
arm64 static calls are nowhere near as significant an optimization (and
can be worse).

I'd be happy to use a runtime constant (modulo my concerns about the
initial value) given that the we already have the infrastructure and the
maintenanace impact is minimal.

Mark.
